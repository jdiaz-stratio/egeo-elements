<section>
   <h2 class="subtitle">Show/Hide fields</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Fields can be hidden or displayed dynamically according to the value of another field. Next, you can see an example to configure the conditions for which a field will be visible. Take into account that all conditions have to be fulfilled to display a field.</p>
   <p class="code-demo">
      {{ {
      ui: {
      visible: {field_key1: 'field_value1', field_key2: 'field_value2'}
      }
      } | json }}
   </p>
   <h2 class="subtitle">Related fields</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">When there are some fields related with each other, they can be placed together in the same line. To place a field next to the next one, you have to add this:</p>

   <p class="code-demo">
      {{ {
      ui: {
      relatedTo: 'next_field_key'
      }
      }| json }}
   </p>

   <h2 class="subtitle">Customization of options in a select</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">When we want to give a more descriptive label to options in a select, we can use the property <b>options</b> of ui.
      There we can define a list of pair of name and value that will be used to create the option menu.</p>
   <p class="paragraph"> If you use this property, you have to know that options will be combined with the options specified in <b>enum</b> property from json schema.
   The options defined in enum property but not in options property will be displayed without label.
   </p>

   <p class="code-demo">
      {{ {
      ui: {
      options: [
      {label: 'Spanish',
      value: 'es'},
      {
      label: 'English',
      value: 'en'
      }
      ]
      } }| json }}
   </p>
