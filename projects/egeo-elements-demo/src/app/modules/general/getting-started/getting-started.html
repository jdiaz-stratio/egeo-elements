<p>
   Egeo is made of several modules to build the whole functionality. The main one is the Angular library that includes
   the components, services and utilities. You can read more about this library, how to work with, how to install it and much
   more in the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo">Readme</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo/wiki">Wiki</a>   of the Github project.
</p>

<p>
   We use Egeo Themes to add styles to the components. By default, <a href="http://www.stratio.com">Stratio</a> provides
   the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-theme">official Egeo theme</a> which the <a href="http://www.stratio.com">Stratio</a>'s
   apps are built. However, you can build your own theme using the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-ui-base">Egeo UI Base library</a>.
</p>

<p>
   We also provide a <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter">Starter Kit</a> you can use to begin a new Angular app
   with Egeo ready to code with the whole dependencies you could need installed and configured (as Egeo, Egeo-theme, Karma
   and Docker). Check the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter">Readme</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter/wiki">Wiki</a>   of the project to know more.
